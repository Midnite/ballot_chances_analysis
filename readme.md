# London Marathon Ballot Chances Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the chances of winning a place in the London Marathon through the ballot system. Specifically, it investigates the impact of submitting two entries instead of one on an individual's chances of success.

## Problem Statement

Every year, a substantial number of runners apply for a limited number of places in the London Marathon via a ballot system. With the introduction of the option to submit two entries instead of one for those willing to pay the entry fee up front and donate it if unsuccessful, we aim to answer the question: Does this new system significantly increase an individual's chances of success, and are the associated costs worth it?

## Dataset

The data used in this notebook are estimates based on numbers reported by the London Marathon and other sources. These include the total number of available places, the total number of applications, and the distribution of entries.

## Methodology

The notebook uses basic probability calculations to estimate the chances of winning a place with one entry versus two. It also explores how other factors, such as the number of other runners with multiple entries and the distribution of non-ballot entries, might affect an individual's chances.

## Findings

The analysis shows that while submitting two entries does increase one's chances of success, the probabilities remain relatively low due to the significant oversubscription of the marathon. Other methods of entry, particularly through charities, might offer higher chances of success for those willing to undertake the associated commitments.
